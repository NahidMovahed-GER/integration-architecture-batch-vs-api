# API vs. Interface – Technical Comparison

This mini project demonstrates two integration approaches:

1) File-based batch interface (CSV): Export and import between systems  
2) REST API (HTTP/JSON): Real-time data access  

Goal: To practically compare architectural and technical differences between integration patterns.
